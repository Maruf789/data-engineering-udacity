## Project Data Lake

This is a demo project for utilizing the power of datalake on AWS platform. 

### What is a data lake?
A data lake is a centralized repository that allows you to store all 
your structured and unstructured data at any scale. You can store your 
data as-is, without having to first structure the data, and run different
types of analyticsâ€”from dashboards and visualizations to big data
processing, real-time analytics, and machine learning to guide better 
decisions.
